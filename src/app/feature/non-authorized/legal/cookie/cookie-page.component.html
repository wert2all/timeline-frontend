      This Cookie Policy explains how we uses cookies and similar technologies
      to recognize you when you visit our website at 
      <a href="https://timeln.rpm.kiev.ua">https://timeln.rpm.kiev.ua</a>. It
      explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your
      rights to control our use of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that
      becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.
    </p>
    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
      device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
      in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
      as to provide reporting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies set by the website owner are called "first-party cookies." Cookies
      set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party
      cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality
      to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
      content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies
      can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question
      and also when it visits certain other websites.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
      are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate,
      and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
      Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
      users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties
      serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other
      purposes. This is described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
      exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
      Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
      categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be
      rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
      our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
      Website though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website
      may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to
      accept or refuse cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our
      Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table below
      (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the
      specific Online Properties you visit):
    </p>
    <h2>Analytics and customization cookies:</h2>
    <p>
      These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to

    <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
      We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
      (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
      graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to
      recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email
      including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor  the traffic
      patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or
      communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
      website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
      to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing
      campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
      function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
    </p>
    <h2>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h2>
    <p>
      Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
      Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
      information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for
      other site operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
      the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the
      tools contained in the 
      <a
        class="link"
        href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        >Website Storage Settings Panel</a
      >. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the 
      <a
        class="link"
        href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        >Global Storage Settings Panel</a
      >
      and following the instructions (which may include instructions that
      explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
      "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
      being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
      Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being
      delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance
      of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
      applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
      connection with our services or online content.

    <h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
    <p>
      Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve
      advertising through our Website. These companies may use information about
      your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
      advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in.
      They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness
      of advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web
      beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites
      in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of
      potential interest to you. The information collected through this process
      does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details, or
      other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide
      these.
