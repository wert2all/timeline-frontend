"""
The @defer directive may be specified on a fragment spread to imply de-prioritization, that causes the fragment to be omitted in the initial response, and delivered as a subsequent response afterward. A query with @defer directive will cause the request to potentially return multiple responses, where non-deferred data is delivered in the initial response and data deferred delivered in a subsequent response. @include and @skip take precedence over @defer.
